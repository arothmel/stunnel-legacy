# stunnel-legacy

âš¡ **Legacy TLS/SSL Handshake Test Container**

This repository provides a test container designed to emulate legacy TLS/SSL handshake environments,  
specifically targeting old systems (like SUSE 8/9) that require **TLS 1.0** or even **SSLv3**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s included?

âœ… `Dockerfile`:  
Builds a container using **Debian 7 Wheezy** to access OpenSSL 1.0.x,  
which supports deprecated protocols like TLSv1 and SSLv3.

âœ… `stunnel.conf`:  
Sample stunnel configuration for setting up client/server tunnels  
using older cipher and protocol settings.

---

## ðŸš€ How to build

```bash
podman build -t stunnel-legacy:debian7 .

## How to run

```bash
podman run --rm stunnel-legacy:debian7


âš  Important Notes

    This container allows unauthenticated package installs
    due to the Debian 7 archiveâ€™s expired GPG keys.
    âœ… Use only for internal testing.

    This is not suitable for production or public deployment.

    Designed to help bridge old systems stuck on legacy protocols
    with modern infrastructure (Camelot, Frodo, etc.).
